# The Jolly Melancholy - Band Site

Hello!

I've been wanting to get into coding for a while and recently I've finally made the jump. 
This is just a simple personal repository for my website idea, my own band site!
I felt this was a good way to test out the code I'm currently learning and implement it in real time.

Thanks for taking a look, I'm always up for comments and suggestions!
